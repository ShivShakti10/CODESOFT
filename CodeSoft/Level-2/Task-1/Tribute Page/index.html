            Mr. Vallabhbhai Patel was an Indian barrister, politician, and one of the leading figures of the country during the Indian freedom movement. During the first three years of Indian independence after 1947, he served as Deputy Prime Minister, Home Minister, Minister of Information, and Minister of State.

In 2014, the Government of India decided to celebrate the birthday of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel as the "National Unity Day" to honour Sardar Patel's contribution to integrated India. Since then, 31 October (the date of birth of Sardar Patel) is celebrated as the "National Unity Day".

Apart from this, the world's tallest statue, the 'Statue of Unity', was dedicated to him on 31 October 2018, which is about 182 meters (597 ft) high.

        <h2>Vallabhbhai Patel’s early life</h2>
            <p>Vallabhbhai Patel was born in Nadiad, Gujarat, on October 31, 1875 (His birth anniversary is now observed as National Unity Day or Rashtriya Ekta Diwas).

                He hailed from a farmer’s family. In his early years, Patel was considered by many as an unambitious man destined for a commonplace job. However, Patel proved them wrong. He passed law examination, often studying himself, with borrowed books.
                
                Patel practised law at Godhra, Borsad, and Anand in Gujarat, after passing the bar examination. He earned the reputation of being a fierce and skilled lawyer.</p>
                Patel had a dream to study law in England. Using his hard-earned savings, he managed to get a pass and a ticket to go to England.

                However, the ticket was addressed to ‘V.J. Patel’. His elder brother Vithalbhai also had the same initials as Vallabhai. Sardar Patel came to know that his elder brother too cherished a dream to go to England for studies.

                In keeping with concerns for his family’s honour (disreputable for an older brother to follow his younger brother), Vallabhbhai Patel allowed Vithalbhai Patel to go, in his place.

            <h2>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's contribution to India's independence movement</h2>
            <p>During the 1930 Salt Satyagraha, Patel was sentenced to three months imprisonment. In March 1931, Patel headed the Karachi session of the Indian National Congress.
                Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel had participated in Gandhi's individual disobedience, was arrested in 1940, and faced nine months of imprisonment. Patel lost more than 20 pounds of weight during his period in jail.
                During Quit India Movement (1942), Sardar Patel was arrested and imprisoned from 1942 to 1945 at the fort in Ahmednagar.
                He led the Congress Party in the 1937 elections and was a major contender for the post of Congress President 1937 but due to Gandhi's pressure, Patel withdrew his nomination and Jawaharlal Nehru was elected as the Congress President.</p>

                <h2>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel as Congress President</h2>
                <p>After the signing of the Gandhi–Irwin Pact, Patel was elected president of Congress for its 1931 session (Karachi).

                    Congress committed itself to the defence of fundamental rights and civil liberties. Patel advocated for the establishment of a secular nation. Minimum wages for workers and the abolition of untouchability were among his other priorities.
                    
                    Patel used his position as Congress president to organise the return of confiscated land to farmers in Gujarat.</p>
                <h2>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s role in the Integration of the princely states</h2>
                <p>Sardar Patel despite his failing health and age never lost sight of the larger purpose of creating United India. As India’s first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, Sardar Patel played a key role in the integration of about 565 princely states into the Indian Union.

                    Few princely states like Travancore, Hyderabad, Junagadh, Bhopal and Kashmir were averse to joining the state of India.
                    
                    Sardar Patel worked tirelessly to build a consensus with the princely states but did not hesitate in employing methods of Sama, Dama, Dand and Bhed where ever necessary.
                    
                    He had used force to annex princely states of Junagadh ruled by Nawab and Hyderabad ruled by Nizam, both of whom had wished not to merge their respective states with the Union of India.
                    
                    Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel stitched the princely states along with British Indian territory and prevented the balkanization of India.</p>
                <h2>Sardar Patel’s Economic Ideas</h2>
                <p>Self-reliance was among the chief tenets of Patel’s economic philosophy. He wanted to see India industrialise quickly. The imperative was to reduce dependence on external resources.

                    Patel guided the cooperative movements in Gujarat and helped in setting up of the Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producers’ Union which proved to be a game-changer for dairy farming throughout the country.
                    
                    Sardar was unimpressed with the slogans raised for socialism and spoke often of the need for India to create wealth before debating over what to do with it, how to share it.
                    
                    The role he envisaged for the government was that of a welfare state but realised that other countries had taken up the task at more advanced stages of development.
                    
                    Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel rejected nationalisation completely and was against controls. To him, the profit motive was a great stimulant to exertion, not a stigma.
                    
                    Patel was against people remaining idle. In 1950 he said, “Millions of idle hands that have no work cannot find employment on machines”. He urged labourers to participate in creating wealth before claiming a just share.
                    
                    Sardar championed investment-led growth. He said, “Spend less, save more, and invest as much as possible should be the motto of every citizen.</p>
                <h2>Statue of Unity, a tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel?</h2>
                <img src="statue.jpg">
                <p>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was an Indian National Congress leader – until his death. Many historians like Ramchandra Guha, thinks it is ironic that Patel is being claimed by the BJP when he “was himself a lifelong Congressman”.

                    Congress leader Shashi Tharoor alleged that BJP was trying to ‘hijack’ the legacy of freedom fighters and national heroes like Patel as they have no leaders of their own in history to celebrate.
                    
                    Many opposition leaders see vested interests in the right-wing party’s effort to appropriate Patel and depict the Nehru family in a bad light.
                    
                    Built at a cost of Rs. 2,989 crore, the statue depicts Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, India’s first Home Minister, wearing a traditional dhoti and shawl, towering over the Narmada River.
                    
                    At 182-metre, the statue is touted as the world’s tallest – it is 177 feet higher than China’s Spring Temple Buddha, currently the world’s tallest statue.
                    
                    Iron was collected from all over the country for the statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, also known as the Iron Man of India.</p>
